# Stock Price Predictions

This is a stock price prediction application which predicts current stock price based on past data. We are using 5 different techniques to perform the prediction and then carry out a comprehensive comparison between each technique. 

We are using historical data for Tata Global Beverage to kick start our project. We will extend our support to following stocks:
Apple, Microsoft and Cisco. As the time permits, we can keep on adding data sets for other companies.

2. Auto-Arima Algorithm
3. KNN(k-Nearest Neighbours Regression)
