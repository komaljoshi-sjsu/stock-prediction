# Stock Price Predictions

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

This stock prediction application will predict trend of the stock. It will also suggest the user whether it is a good time to buy this particular stock or sell it. 

Accuracy of the trend can be verified from the real-time data we are using by visualizing in the graph.

**Data Set**

We are using yfinance to take real time data of stocks. This api allows user to get data based on any given time-frame.

## Techniques for Stock Prediction

**1. LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) (Komal)**

Following link is used to understand about LSTM:

We can use the trend of the above graph advise user whether to buy or sell stock.

**Tools and Libraries**:

sklearn, keras, matplotlib, pandas, yfinance and numpy.
